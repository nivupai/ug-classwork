# Outline the system structure (including necessary files and directories for running the code)

# System Structure
code/: directory containing main python script for temporal extraction (assignment-1.ipynb)
data/: stores input and output data
data/input/: contains input file (input.txt) including sentences with data-related texts
data/output/: contains output file (output.txt) where extracted temporal entities are stored
README.md: contains instructions on running the code and information on this assignemnt's implementation

# System Description
Regular expression was used to capture day, month, and year information. This regex accounts for variations in the representation of days (st, nd, rd, th) and supports 
month names and abbreviations. Regex patterns were designed to identify day of the week formats, both with and without the explicit mention of "the." 
Specific regex patterns were crafted to identify common holidays, specific times of the day, standalone years and standalone month names (abbreviated and normal).
The regular expressions are designed to be case-insensitive to account for variations in capitalization. Dates extracted from the text are stored in a Python list (`dates`). 
This list is later used to write the identified dates to the output file. The system uses the re module in Python for regular expression matching.
