## N-Gram Language Models Applied to the Task of Language Identification

### Description of the Problem Solved
The program implements N-gram language models for the task of language identification. It uses letter bigram and word bigram models with different smoothing techniques to predict the language of input texts based on the observed letter or word sequences.

### How to Run
1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:** Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can open Jupyter Notebook by either searching for it in your applications or using the command line (`jupyter notebook`).

2. **Navigate to the Code Directory:** Once Jupyter Notebook is open, navigate to the directory where your code files (`letterLangId.ipynb`, `wordLangId.ipynb`, `wordLangId2.ipynb`) are located. This directory should be within the `src/Code/` directory of your project.

3. **Open the Desired Notebook:** Click on the notebook file you want to run (`letterLangId.ipynb`, `wordLangId.ipynb`, or `wordLangId2.ipynb`) to open it in Jupyter Notebook.

4. **Run Cells:** Within the notebook, you will find code cells containing the program's code. You can run each cell individually by clicking on it and then pressing Shift + Enter. Alternatively, you can run all cells at once by going to the "Cell" menu and selecting "Run All."

5. **Follow Instructions:** The notebook will guide you through the execution of the program, including loading data, preprocessing, training the language models, applying smoothing techniques, and generating output files.

6. **Review Output:** After running the program, review the output files (`letterLangId.out`, `wordLangId.out`, `wordLangId2.out`) located in the `src/Data/Output/` directory. These files contain the language predictions for each sentence in the test data.
